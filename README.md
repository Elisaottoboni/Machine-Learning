# Machine Learning Course Repository

This repository was created for the [FYS-STK3155/FYS4155 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html) (Autumn 2024) course at the University of Oslo. It contains files and materials for the weekly exercises as well as the different projects completed throughout the course.

## Contents
- **Weekly Exercises**: Each folder (e.g., `week_35`, `week_36`, etc.) contains the exercises and assignments from each week of the course.
- **Projects**: The `Project1`, `Project2` and `Project3` folders contain the files, code, and documentation for the larger, more comprehensive projects assigned during the course.
